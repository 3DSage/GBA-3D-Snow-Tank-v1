I am so proud of my new 3D Game Boy Advance game and I want you to play it 
and beat my high score! I made everything you see including writing the game engine.
This is a real GBA game that can run on an emulator or the actual GBA hardware.

The objective is to collect the white snow on the floor and blow apart the 
larger snow blocks. Your time remaining is added to your score so to get a high score, 
beat the game faster! A score of 45 is pretty good but Iâ€™m sure you beat that.
